<b><u>Brief Summary of C.A.R.T</u></b>
<br>

```[Problem]```
Many individuals, including delivery workers, university students, and people with physical disabilities, face significant challenges in reaching various locations due to limited accessibility and the high cost of infrastructure.

```[Stakeholders_and_Why_It_Matters]``` 
Current solutions often rely on cars and trucks, which are inefficient, time-consuming, and impractical for off-road or uneven terrains, especially where parking availability is inconsistent.

```[Focus_and_Objective]``` 
To address these challenges, a semi-autonomous robotic cart is proposed to assist individuals in carrying their belongings efficiently and affordably. The embedded system will provide a reliable means of transport across diverse environments while reducing the physical burden of carrying loads.

```[How]```
The mechanical and electrical design of the cart will incorporate low-cost motors and materials in order to make it affordable.
